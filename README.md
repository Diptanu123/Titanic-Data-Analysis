# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to analyze passenger demographics and survival patterns.  
Using **Python libraries** such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to uncover meaningful insights about the disaster.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed missing or inconsistent data (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Fare`, `Cabin`).
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of age, gender, and class.
  - Correlation between features such as **gender, passenger class, and survival**.
- Created **visualizations** using Matplotlib & Seaborn for better insights.
- Summarized key findings that highlight survival trends.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - NumPy (numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
  - Jupyter Notebook (analysis & reporting)

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains passenger details such as:
  - Name, Age, Sex, Class, Ticket, Fare, Embarked location, Cabin
  - Target variable: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
